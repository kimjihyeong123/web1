            In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank" title="what is formula">science <a/> , a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically,
            as in a mathematical formula or a chemical formula. The informal use of the ter
            m formula in science refers to the general construct of a relationship between given
            quantities.
            The plural of formula can be spelled either as formulas (from the most common English p
            lural noun form) or, under the influence of scientific Latin, formulae (from the original Latin).[1]
            In mathematics, a formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules o
            f a given logical language.[2] For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a sign
            ificant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion;[3] but,
            having done this once in terms of some parameter (the radius for example), mathematicians have
            produced a formula to describe the volume:

      Having obtained this result, the <strong>volume of any <u>sphere can be computed</u></strong> as long as its
      radius is known. Note that the volume V and the radius r are expressed as single letter
      s instead of words or phrases. This convention, while less important in a relatively simple
      formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate larger and more complex formulas.
      [4] Mathematical formulas [5] are often algebraic, closed form, and/or analytical.
      In modern chemistry, a chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of
      atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols,
      numbers, and sometimes other symbols, such as parentheses, brackets, and plus (+) and minus (−) signs.[6]
      For example, H2O is the chemical formula for water, specifying that each molecule consists of two hydrogen
      (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. Similarly, O−
      3 denotes an ozone molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms and having a net negative charge.
      In a general context, formulas are applied to provide a mathematical solution for real world problems. Some may be general: for example,</p>
