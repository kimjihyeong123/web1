  <h2>physics</h2>
    <p>When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity" target="_blank" title="specification of vel">velocity</a> of an object changes it is said to be accelerating. Acceleration
     is the rate of change of velocity with time.
    In everyday English, the word acceleration is often used to describe a state of inc
    reasing speed. <strong>For many <u> Americans</u>, their </strong>only experience with acceleration comes from car ads.
    When a commercial shouts "zero to sixty in six point seven seconds" what they're s
    aying here is that this particular car takes 6.7 s to reach a
    speed of 60 mph starting from a complete stop. This example illustrates acceleratio
    n as it is commonly understood,

  but acceleration in physics is much more than just increasing speed.
  Any change in the velocity of an object results in an acceleration: increasing spee
  d (what people usually mean when they say acceleration), decreas
  ing speed (also called deceleration or retardation), or changing direction (calle
  d centripetal acceleration). Yes, that's right,
  a change in the direction of motion results in an acceleration even if the moving
  object neither sped up nor slowed down. That's because accel
  eration depends on the change in velocity and velocity is a vector quantity â€” one
  with both magnitude and direction. Thus, a falling apple accelerates,
  a car stopping at a traffic light accelerates, and an orbiting planet acceler
  ates. Acceleration occurs anytime an object's speed increases or
   decreases, or it changes direction.</p>
