      <p>The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of
        reference, and is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_key" target="_blank" title="function defined by wikipedia">function</a> of
        time. Velocity is equivalent to  a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60 km/h to the north).
        Velocity is a fundamental
        oncept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that   describes the motion of bodies.
        Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and
        direction are needed to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity
        is called speed, being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI
        (metric system) as metres per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m⋅s−1). For example,
        "5 metres per second" is a scalar, whereas "5 metres per second east" is a vector. If there
        is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said
        to be undergoing an acceleration.</p>

    <strong>To have a <u>constant velocity</u></strong>, an object must have a constant speed in a constant direction.
     Constant direction constrains the object to motion in a straight path thus, a constant velocity
      means motion in a straight line at a constant speed.
  For example, a car moving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular path has a constant speed
   but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes. Hence, the car is considered to be undergoing an acceleration.
