                <span style ="font-weight:bold;">In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank" title="what is formula">science <a/></span> , a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically,
                as in a ma<span id = "first" class = "the">the</span>matical formula or a chemical formula. <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> informal use of <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> ter
                m formula in science refers to <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> general construct of a relationship between given
                quantities.
                <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> plural of formula can be spelled ei<span id = "first" class = "the">the</span>r as formulas (from <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> most common English p
                lural noun form) or, under <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> influence of scientific Latin, formulae (from <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> original Latin).[1]
                In ma<span id = "first" class = "the">the</span>matics, a formula is an entity constructed using <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> symbols and formation rules o
                f a given logical language.[2] For example, determining <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> volume of a sphere requires a sign
                ificant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> method of exhaustion;[3] but,
                having done this once in terms of some parameter (<span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> radius for example), ma<span id = "first" class = "the">the</span>maticians have
                produced a formula to describe <span id = "first" class = "the">the</span> volume:
